📝 Python To-Do List Application (CLI + GUI)
📌 Project Overview

This project is a Python-based To-Do List Manager that allows users to create, view, edit, and complete tasks. The application is implemented in two versions:

Command Line Interface (CLI) version for terminal interaction

Graphical User Interface (GUI) version built using FreeSimpleGUI

All tasks are stored in a text file so that the to-do list persists even after the program is closed.

🎯 Project Objectives

Build a practical task management application using Python

Practice file handling, functions, and modular programming

Implement both CLI and GUI interfaces

Demonstrate basic software structure and code reusability

File Descriptions

functions.py

Contains reusable functions for reading and writing todo tasks from a text file.

get_todos() → Reads tasks from the file

write_todos() → Saves updated tasks to the file

These functions handle file operations for the application. 

todo.py

Implements the command-line version of the To-Do application.

Users can type commands such as:

add → Add a new task

show → Display all tasks

edit → Modify an existing task

complete → Mark a task as completed

exit → Close the program

The program continuously runs in a loop and processes user input to manage tasks.

to-do-gui.py

Implements a Graphical User Interface version using FreeSimpleGUI.

The GUI includes:

Input box for entering tasks

Listbox showing all current tasks

Buttons to add and edit tasks

Dynamic updates to the task list

This version provides a more user-friendly interface for managing the to-do list.

⚙️ Features
